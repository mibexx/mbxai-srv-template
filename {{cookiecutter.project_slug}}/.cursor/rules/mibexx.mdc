## Python Version
- Always use Python 3.12 or higher

## Application Architecture
- There are 3 main applications: api, mcp, and ui
- Logic in UI should use an endpoint in api with proxy in frontend app

## API Design
- All endpoints must have ONE pydantic model as request and response

## AI Communication
- For AI communication use the mbxai package with McpClient (check utils/client -> get_mcp_client)
- Always use the "parse" method of McpClient
- Pydantic models for parse must always have only required fields

## Development Practices
- Never write tests when it's not explicitly required
